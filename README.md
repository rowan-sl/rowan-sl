### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rowan, also known as [mtnash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain-ash). I mostly use rust now, but before that I did a few things [of intrest](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash/ash-home-assistant) in python.

#### I have a website
[check it out!](https://fawkes.io)

#### I'm on matrix
my mxid is `@mtnash:matrix.fawkes.io`

#### Microsoft sucks
... and they own github, so you can find more of my projects on my [git server](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash) (some may have mirrors here, some may not)

#### Stats

###### Project status
<sup><sub>Most repos under this account are not maintained (due me loosing intrest)<br>if you have some changes or updates you want to see, please, write an issue!<br>Also, I'm still in high school, so my time to work on projects is limited</sub></sup>

## Activity Log: many of my projects are *only* on my [git server](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash) - look there for accurate (recent) activity
