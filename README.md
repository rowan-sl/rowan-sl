### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rowan, also known as [mtnash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain-ash). I mostly use rust now, but before that I did a few things [of intrest](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash/ash-home-assistant) in python.

#### I have a website
<https://fawkes.io>, check it out!

#### Microsoft sucks
... and they own github, so you can find my projects on my [git server](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash)

# *All* of my (current) projects are *only* on my [git server](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash) - look there for accurate activity (though that does not show private contributions)

This is why my github activity log is empty

If you want to contribute to, or file an issue on, a project on my git server, [contact](https://fawkes.io/pages/contact) me, I don't bite!<br><sup><sub>Unless you want to talk to me about crypto or AI. Don't do that.</sub></sup>
