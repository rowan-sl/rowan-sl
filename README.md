### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rowan, also known as [mtnash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain-ash). I mostly use rust now, but before that I did a few things [of intrest](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash/ash-home-assistant) in python.

#### I have a website
[check it out!](https://fawkes.io)

#### Microsoft sucks
... and they own github, so you can find more of my projects on my [git server](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash) (some may have mirrors here, some may not)

# *All* of my (current) projects are *only* on my [git server](https://git.fawkes.io/mtnash) - look there for accurate (recent) activity (though that does not show private contributions)
This is with the exception of a few projects that have mirror repositories on github.

This is why my github activity log is empty

If you want to contribute to, or file an issue on, a project without a github mirror, [contact](https://fawkes.io/pages/contact) me, I don't bite!<br><sup><sub>Unless you want to talk to me about crypto or AI. Don't do that.</sub></sup>
